On Raspberry Pi:

Open terminal and edit the network interfaces file
Assuming nano text editor is installed use:
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
Add these lines at the end:
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.100/24
(We can use a different ip if needed.)
Save and exit
Reboot

On Laptop:

Go to network settings
Set a static IP for the Ethernet connection (192.168.1.101)
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 this matches the IP


3. Software Setup
On Raspberry Pi:
Create a new file receive_commands.py
Type out the receive_commands file 
Save and exit

On Laptop:

Use send_commands.py
Ensure the IP address in the code matches your Raspberry Pi's IP (192.168.1.100)

4. Running the Scripts
On Raspberry Pi:
Open terminal
Navigate to the directory containing receive_commands.py
Run:
python3 receive_commands.py

On Laptop:

Open command prompt/terminal
Navigate to the directory containing send_commands.py
Run:
python send_commands.py


5. Testing

On your laptop, you should see a prompt to enter a command
Type a test command
Press Enter
Check the Raspberry Pi terminal - you should see the received command
Check your laptop - you should see the response from the Raspberry Pi
Try sending multiple commands to ensure consistent communication

6. Troubleshooting

If connection fails, ensure both devices are on the same subnet
Check if any firewalls are blocking the connection
Verify the Ethernet cable is functioning properly
Ensure the correct IP addresses and port numbers are used in both scripts
